    <h3>motiv8 Terms of Use</h3><br>
    <h5>Last Updated: December 28, 2017</h5>
    <p>motiv8 is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts
        (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to own, transfer, and breed genetically unique digital cats, which
        can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the “Site”). The Smart Contracts and the
        Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App”. Using the App, users can view their cats and use
        the Smart Contracts to acquire, trade, and breed cats with other App users via clock auction.</p>
    <p>4IRE labs, Inc. ("we", or "us") is making the App available to you. Before you use the App, the Smart Contracts,
        or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated
        herein by reference (collectively, these “Terms"). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE
        SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS
        WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP,
        THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART
        CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN
        ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE
        ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL
        AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO
        NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE
        SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE
        APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.</p>
    <h4>The App</h4>
    <p>A. To most easily use the App, you must first install the Google Chrome web browser. Once you have installed
        Chrome, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which
        allows you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third party
        sites), store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any
        transactions on the App other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible browsers). The App will only
        recognize you as a user, and you will only be able to interact with the App, if your Ethereum electronic wallet
        is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. There is no other way to sign up as a user, or to
        interact directly with the App.</p>
    <p>B. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand
        that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the
        App.</p>
    <p>C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party
        site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the
        various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will
        we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with
        any such third parties.</p>
    <p>D. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. By
        creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and
        to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information. You are responsible for the security of
        your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts). If you become aware of any
        unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at
        ms@4irelabs.com.</p>
    <h4>2. Ownership; Restrictions</h4>

        other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other materials that you may access on or through the
        App. We reserve all rights in and to the Materials not expressly granted to you in the Terms.</p>
    <p>B. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without
        limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that
        we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose
        such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a
        perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use
        your Feedback for any purpose.</p>
    <p>C. You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any
        consequences thereof. You agree to use the App only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with
        these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you may not, and
        may not allow any third party to: (i) send, upload, distribute or disseminate any unlawful, defamatory,
        harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content; (ii) distribute viruses, worms,
        defects, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature; (iii)
        impersonate another person (via the use of an email address or otherwise); (iv) upload, post, transmit or
        otherwise make available through the App any content that infringes the intellectual proprietary rights of any
        party; (v) use the App to violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others; (vi)
        engage in, promote, or encourage illegal activity (including, without limitation, money laundering); (vii)
        interfere with other users’ enjoyment of the App; (viii) exploit the App for any unauthorized commercial
        purpose; (ix) modify, adapt, translate, or reverse engineer any portion of the App; (x) remove any copyright,
        trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the App or any part of it; (xi) reformat or
        frame any portion of the App; (xii) display any content on the App that contains any hate-related or violent
        content or contains any other material, products or services that violate or encourage conduct that would
        violate any criminal laws, any other applicable laws, or any third party rights; (xiii) use any robot, spider,
        site search/retrieval application, or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the App or the content
        posted on the App, or to collect information about its users for any unauthorized purpose; (xiv) create user
        accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent pretenses; or (xv) access or use the App for the
        purpose of creating a product or service that is competitive with any of our products or services.</p>
    <h4>3. Termination</h4>
    <p>You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the App and discontinuing your access to
        and use of the App. You will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account, or otherwise terminate these
        Terms. You agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend
        and/or terminate your account(s) for the App. You agree that any suspension or termination of your access to the
        App may be without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such
        suspension or termination. If we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the App
        due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, then termination of
        these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity. Upon any termination or
        expiration of these Terms, whether by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have
        posted on the App or that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation to
        maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such information to you or to any third party.
        Sections 2.C and 3 through 16 will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason.</p>
    <h4>4. Disclaimers</h4>
    <p>A. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THAT THE
        APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE
        FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO
        EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE APP AND ANY PART OF IT (INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SITE, ANY SMART CONTRACT, OR ANY EXTERNAL WEBSITES), INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY.
        WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS DO NOT

        THROUGH THE APP WILL BE ACCURATE, (III) THE APP OR ANY CONTENT, SERVICES, OR FEATURES MADE AVAILABLE ON OR
        THROUGH THE APP ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR (IV) THAT ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE WHEN
        YOU USE THE APP WILL BE SECURE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS
        WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    <p>B. YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET, AND
        AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS
        NEGLIGENCE.</p>
    <p>C. WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR AS THE RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE ETHEREUM
        NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING
        FROM: (A) USER ERROR, SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS OR INCORRECTLY CONSTRUED SMART CONTRACTS OR OTHER
        TRANSACTIONS; (B) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (C) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITIES
        BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF

    <p>D. motiv8 ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE
        ETHEREUM NETWORK. ALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE CONDUCTED AND OCCUR ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM

        NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.</p>
    <h4>5. Limitation of Liability</h4>
    <p>A. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO
        ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR,
        HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS (WHETHER
        INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
        SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>B. YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
        THESE TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) ANY PORTION OF THE APP, WHETHER IN
        CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU
        ACTUALLY PAID US UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR (B) $100.</p>
    <p>C. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE
        UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR
        ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US. WE WOULD NOT BE
        ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.</p>
    <p>D. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND SOME
        JURISDICTIONS ALSO LIMIT DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS, SO
        THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS.</p>
    <h4>6. Assumption of Risk</h4>
    You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
    <p>A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets
        could materially and adversely affect the value of your motiv8, which may also be subject to significant price
        volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of motiv8 will not lose money.</p>
    <p>B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your motiv8-related transactions. 4IRE
        labs is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the
        Smart Contracts.</p>
    <p>C. The App does not store, send, or receive motiv8. This is because motiv8 exist only by virtue of the ownership
        record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of motiv8 occurs
        within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the App.</p>
    <p>D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of
        hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
        third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and
        acknowledge that 4IRE labs will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors,
        distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.</p>
    <p>E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively
        impact the development of the motiv8 ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of motiv8.</p>
    <p>F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new
        regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the motiv8 ecosystem, and therefore
        the potential utility or value of motiv8.</p>
    <p>G. Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how
        transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains
        using the ERC-20 standard, including the motiv8. ecosystem.</p>
    <h4>7. Indemnification</h4>
    <p>You agree to hold harmless and indemnify 4IRE labs and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees,
        advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and
        consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys’ fees arising out of or in
        any way related to (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your misuse of the App, or (iii) your violation of
        applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App. You agree that 4IRE
        labs will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.</p>
    <h4>8. External Sites</h4>
    <p>The App may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”), which are
        provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and
        agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any
        advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites. Furthermore, you
        acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the
        availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the
        completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from,
        any External Sites.</p>
    <h4>9. Changes to the Terms</h4>
    <p>The App may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”), which are
        provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and
        agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any
        advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites. Furthermore, you
        acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the
        availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the
        completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from,
        any External Sites.</p>
    <h4>10. Changes to the App</h4>
    <p>We may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When we make changes, we will make the updated Terms
        available on the App and update the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly. Please
        check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made,
        and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding
        acceptance of the updates. If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.</p>
    <h4>11. Children</h4>
    <p>You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the App is not intended for children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR
        OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER
        AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU
        AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS. YOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN
        REVIEW AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON YOUR BEHALF. IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AGREEING TO THE TERMS FOR THE
        BENEFIT OF A CHILD OVER 13, THEN YOU AGREE TO AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT CHILD’S USE OF THE APP,
        INCLUDING ALL FINANCIAL CHARGES AND LEGAL LIABILITY THAT HE OR SHE MAY INCUR.</p>
    <h4>12. Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is
        hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and
        disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h4>13. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h4>
    <p>Please read this Section 15 carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with 4IRE labs, and limits the
        manner in which you can seek relief from us.</p>
    <p>All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without limitation your access or use of
        the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, or to any products sold or distributed through the App, the Site, or
        the Smart Contracts, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British
        Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The appointing authority will be the British Columbia
        International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be
        administered by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre in accordance with its
        applicable rules. Each party will cover its own fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings;
        however, if the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the fees and costs reasonably associated with the
        arbitration proceedings, 4IRE labs will pay them for you. The place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British
        Columbia, Canada. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions.
        The language of the arbitration will be English. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and any
        judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, 4IRE labs may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court
        of competent jurisdiction, and you agree that these Terms are specifically enforceable by 4IRE labs through
        injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.</p>
    <p>WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES
        RELATED TO THE APP, THE SITE, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR ANY PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE APP, THE
        SITE, OR THE SMART CONTRACTS: (I) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY; AND (II) YOU
        HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, INCLUDING
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</p>
    <h4>14. General</h4>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and 4IRE labs, govern your access to and use of the
        App, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties related to your access
        to or use of the App, whether oral or written. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The
        parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms create any agency, partnership, or joint
        venture. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against
        any party. You may not assign any or your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law
        or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in
        our sole discretion to an affiliate, or in connection with an acquisition, sale or merger. Should any part of
        these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and
        the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms
        will not be deemed a waiver of such provision, nor of the right to enforce such provision. These Terms will be
        governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada and the
        federal laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles. Subject to
        Section 13, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal
        or provincial courts located in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal
        jurisdiction and venue there. We will not be liable for any failure or delayed performance of our obligations
        that result from any condition beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, governmental
        action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood, acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, Internet
        disturbances, or acts or omissions of third parties. You agree that we may provide you with notices (including,
        without limitation those regarding changes to these Terms) by email, regular mail, or postings on the App. By
        providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices
        required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.</p>
