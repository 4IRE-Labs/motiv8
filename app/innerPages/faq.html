        <h3>Getting Started</h3><br>
        <h5 class="accordion-toggle">What do I need to use motiv8?</h5>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Here’s what you need to get started:
            <ul>
                <li>A computer or laptop running the desktop version of Chrome, Firefox or Opera</li>
                <li>MetaMask, a digital wallet used specifically with web apps</li>
                <li>Ether, a form of digital payment that powers motiv8</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h5 class="accordion-toggle">Installing MetaMask, your digital wallet</h5>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>To use motib8, you will need to install MetaMask, a digital wallet.
                You will need to put money in it to make your first purchase.
                Note: A digital wallet like MetaMask acts like a bank account—treat it with respect and make
                sure you don’t forget your password or the seed words.</p>
        </div>

        <h5 class="accordion-toggle">Why is MetaMask locked?</h5>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Occasionally motiv8 page displays a lock screen. This happens because MetaMask locks your account
                after a certain period of time automatically. To unlock simply click on the MetaMask extension and
                type in your password.</p>

        <h3>Getting rewarded</h3><br>
        <h5 class="accordion-toggle">How do I get a rewards badge?</h5>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>In current version you need to donate Ethereum to the proposed charities (use Rinkeby test network).</p>
        </div>
        <h5 class="accordion-toggle">Why is it so complicated to get started with motiv8?</h5>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>motiv8 is built on blockchain technology, which is relatively new stuff.
                It’s safe and secure, but it’s going to be a little complicated until the rest of the world cat-ches
                up.</p>
